Observation-Charts
======================

Generate beautiful SVG star charts.

Goal: Create dynamic charts that resemble the IAU Constellation
charts. This is a disjointed collection of stuff at the moment that is
slowly coalescing into an orderly pairing of a Python package that
generates GeoJSON from celestial catalogs and a JavaScript library that
generates the SVG charts.
